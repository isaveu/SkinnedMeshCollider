# SkinnedMeshCollider
Created a skinned mesh Collider script based on a reddit post + comments by 907games https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/f18rfu/skinned_mesh_collider_first_implementation_still/

I'm using this for giant boss fights ^_^ Thanks to 907games for being so generous with his tips and info!

This script allows you to generate a mesh collider for an animated skinned mesh renderer, it generates the mesh/collider based on the distance from the target in LateUpdate.
